# AutoScaling the VM-Series on Google Cloud Platform

The Google Cloud Platform Plugin for Panorama 1.0 Beta2  helps you configure a connection from
Panorama to a GCP project and VMs deployed within it. You can use the web interface to
globally enable monitoring for a GCP project, configure VM monitoring for a GCP project, and
configure connections to VMs in autoscaling and Kubernetes deployments. Once a connection
is established, the plugin can retrieve predefined or user-defined metadata (predefined
attributes, user-defined labels for VMs, and user-defined network tags as listed in Attributes,
Tags, and Labels).
